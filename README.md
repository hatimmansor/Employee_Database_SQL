# Background:
In this project I played a role as data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (in project scenario). My first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

In this project, I have designed the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. I have performed:
1. Data Engineering
2. Data Analysis
